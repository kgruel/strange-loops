# CLAUDE.md — hlab

Homelab monitoring and management CLI. DSL defines status data flow, Python handles everything else.

## The Model

**Facts flow into Vertices. Vertices fold Facts through Specs. Boundaries emit Ticks. Ticks flow onward as Facts. The loop closes.**

Three truths:
- **Time is fundamental.** Facts are observations of what occurred. You are always in the present, observing an ordered past.
- **The observer is first-class.** Facts exist because someone observed them. The `observer` field carries attribution.
- **Everything is loops.** Facts flow in, accumulate into state, boundaries fire, ticks flow out. The end connects to the beginning.

Three atoms:
```
Fact    what happened           kind + ts + payload + observer
Spec    how state accumulates   fields + folds + boundary
Tick    what a period became    name + ts + payload + origin
```

## Run

```bash
uv run hlab                        # default (status)
uv run hlab status                 # stack container status
uv run hlab alerts                 # Prometheus alert status
uv run hlab logs <stack>           # stream docker compose logs
uv run hlab media audit            # scan for corrupt media files
uv run hlab media fix              # fix corrupt media files
uv run hlab sync uptime-kuma       # sync Uptime Kuma monitors
python -m hlab                     # alternative invocation
```

Common flags (all commands):
```
-q, --quiet     Minimal output (one-liner)
-v              Detailed output
-vv             Full detail
-i              Interactive TUI (where supported)
--json          JSON output
--plain         No ANSI codes
```

## Two Command Patterns

### Fetch-then-render (most commands)

`make_fetcher` returns a zero-arg callable. `_run_command` in `main.py` handles the fidelity→format→output pipeline:

```
main.py routes command
  → make_fetcher(args) returns fetch()
  → _run_command(args, render_fn, fetch_fn)
    → parse fidelity (Zoom × OutputMode × Format)
    → fetch data
    → render_fn(ctx, data) → Block
    → print_block(block)
```

Commands using this: `status`, `alerts`, `media audit`.

### Streaming/interactive (run_X)

Some commands manage their own async lifecycle. `main.py` creates `CliContext` and passes it through:

```
main.py routes command
  → detect_context(zoom, mode, fmt) → CliContext
  → run_X(ctx, args) → int
```

Commands using this: `logs`, `media fix`, `sync uptime-kuma`, and `status -i` (TUI).

## DSL Scope

**Only `status` uses the DSL.** The `.vertex` file defines sources (SSH → docker compose ps → ndjson) and fold boundaries. All other commands are direct Python — they fetch data from APIs or run shell commands without the DSL pipeline.

## Data Flow (status)

```
status.vertex (DSL)
  → compile_sources() → Source[]
  → compile_vertex_recursive() → CompiledVertex
  → materialize_vertex(compiled, fold_overrides) → Vertex

Runner(vertex) + runner.add(source)
  → async for tick in runner.run():
      stacks[tick.name] = tick.payload

status_view(stacks, zoom, width, theme) → Block
```

Each source emits facts with its own kind, then `{kind}.complete`. The `.complete` fact triggers that stack's boundary. Four sources = four loops = four ticks.

## Fold → Lens

**Fold computes, lens presents.**

- `folds.py`: `health_fold` accumulates containers, computes healthy/total as state builds. `HEALTH_INITIAL` seeds the state.
- `lenses/status.py`: `status_view` takes computed `{stack_name: payload}` and renders at zoom level. `render_plain` for non-TTY. `stack_lens` and TUI panel renderers for interactive mode.

```
Source emits container facts
  → health_fold accumulates + computes metrics
    → Tick payload = {containers, healthy, total}
      → status_view renders at zoom level
```

Fold overrides are wired in `commands/status.py`:
```python
fold_overrides = {
    kind: (HEALTH_INITIAL, health_fold)
    for kind in template_specs.keys()
}
vertex = materialize_vertex(compiled, fold_overrides=fold_overrides)
```

## Fidelity

Zoom × OutputMode × Format from `cells.fidelity`:

- **Zoom**: MINIMAL (one-liner) → SUMMARY (tree) → DETAILED (bordered tree) → FULL (TUI)
- **OutputMode**: AUTO (detect), STATIC, INTERACTIVE
- **Format**: ANSI, PLAIN, JSON

`add_cli_args(parser)` adds the standard flags. `detect_context(zoom, mode, fmt)` produces `CliContext` with resolved width, zoom, mode, format.

## Adding a Command

1. Create `commands/your_command.py` with `make_fetcher(args)` (fetch-then-render) or `run_X(ctx, args)` (streaming).
2. Create `lenses/your_command.py` with a view function: `(data, zoom, width, theme) → Block`.
3. Wire in `main.py`: add subparser, import, route.

Follow the fetch-then-render pattern unless you need streaming or interactive control.

## Boundaries: Semantic Time

Boundaries fire on domain semantics, not clocks. The question isn't "how much time has passed?" but "what just happened that gives meaning to everything before it?"

In hlab: each source emits facts with its own kind (`infra`, `media`, `dev`, `minecraft`), then `{kind}.complete`. The `.complete` fact triggers that stack's boundary.

## Gotchas

- **tick.name IS the stack name.** No re-grouping needed in render — state is already per-stack.
- **Tick payload has pre-computed metrics.** `payload = {containers: [...], healthy: N, total: M}`. Access directly, don't recompute.
- **One tick per stack, not one aggregated tick.** Each source fires its own boundary.
- **Boundaries are semantic.** They fire when data says so, not on timers.

## Working Here

1. **Run first, then code** — Print actual tick payloads before writing render logic.
2. **DSL is source of truth** — No hardcoded config that duplicates the `.vertex` file.
3. **Trace data, not code** — When debugging, feed facts and print state.
4. **Fidelity is render-side** — DSL doesn't know about zoom levels; that's cells' job.
5. **Boundaries are semantic** — They fire when data says so, not on timers.
